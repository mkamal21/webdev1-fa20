        The Apple Prototype was my take on the 1990s apple shoe that was given to employees who worked for the company. I decided to bring that back to life but in my own way.
        I took a modern approach to the vintage shoe made in 90s. I added a apple logos on multiple sides of the shoe and also incorporated an apple watch built in the left side of the shoe. 
        My reason for making this shoe is to show how much apple has grown since the 90s. To check out more about the 1990s Apple shoe click the link below.
