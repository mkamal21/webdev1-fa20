    <h1>My View </h1>

    <p>My personal review of the web is complex. They are times where i love and they are times where I hate it. From laughing at memes to reading about conspiracy theories we are living in a wolrd where information is passed around like a bag of chips at a party. Thats what I believe makes the web so fun and addictive. If I would to give a review about the web I don't thing I would be able to give a definitive answer. Some things can be amazing on the web where others can be absolutely absurd. As far as my view on the web I believe it's very helpful and important to us. </p>

    <p>I hope I made sense lol</p>

    <p>:)/10 I smiled when I did this</p>
